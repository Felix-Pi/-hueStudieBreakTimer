# hueStudyBreakTimer

I tend to forget making breaks, so I created this little script to remember me ever hour to make a little break by blinking my lights and showing a little notification.

Configuration is pretty easy. `config.py` contains `ip` and `api_key` of the philips hue bridge (creation of api_key is not part of this script)
